            <h1>Make Something People Want to be a Part Of</h1>
            <p>Seed Club is an internet institution serving the founders, investors, and explorers of the consumer crypto frontier. We invest, we experiment, we convene, and we report back from the edges.</p>
            <p>We kicked off this adventure 4 years ago after becoming captivated with how tokens were allowing social and cultural value to be created, stored, and used in entirely new ways. It was obvious to us back then, and is even more so today, that the internet is going to reorganize around this new ability.</p>
            <p>And fuckin hell do we need it. The internet has become predictable, boring, sterile, over-professionalized, and dominated by platforms that extract more than they empower. We’ve been locked into Disneyland instead of released into Tokyo.</p>
            <p>As the global crisis of meaning continues intensifying and the cost of content and software creation trends towards zero, all value will flow to brand and community. We’re entering a new era of the internet where making things people want to be a part of is the killer opportunity, and crypto is the tech stack that unlocks it.</p>
            <p>The infrastructure cycle is over, tokens are running rampant, crypto is becoming cool, and we can finally build applications with millions of transacting users. The golden age of crypto startup building is here, and we’re going to blow the internet back open.</p>
            <p>Come with?</p>
